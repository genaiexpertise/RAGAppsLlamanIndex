*** 
Welcome to the RAG Application Development Using Llamanindex Orchestration Framework course repository! This repository contains all the materials, code, and resources you'll need to follow along with the course and complete the exercises and final project.


### Course Overview
This course will teach you how to develop Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications using the Llamanindex Orchestration Framework. You'll learn how to leverage Llamanindex for efficient data retrieval, manage workflows, integrate with language models, and deploy end-to-end RAG applications.
