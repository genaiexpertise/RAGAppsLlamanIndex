      "The documents discussed in the provided context primarily focus on the requirements and considerations related to providing evidence of harm in cases where a violation of human rights has occurred. The African Court Law Reports Volume 5 (2021) highlight the importance of not only proving that a state has violated provisions of the Charter but also demonstrating the harm suffered by the applicant seeking compensation. The Court emphasizes that a mere violation of the Charter is insufficient to establish material harm and that evidence of harm must be presented to support claims for damages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the documents mention that the need for supporting documents varies on a case-by-case basis, with human rights bodies and courts being sensitive to the challenges victims may face in obtaining evidence due to circumstances such as displacement or the destruction of evidence. In situations where evidence is unavailable or limited, courts often assess the internal consistency, level of detail, and plausibility of the applications in relation to the evidence as a whole. Additionally, reparations may be awarded even when documentation of damages is incomplete or non-existent, especially when it is logical that damages would have been incurred as a direct result of the established violations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The documents also discuss the specific case where the Applicant was arrested, detained, and arbitrarily expelled from a state, leading to their current refugee status in another country. This case highlights the challenging conditions under which the Applicant has been subjected to and the impact of human rights violations on their life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the documents reference various legal cases and jurisprudence to support the principles discussed, including the need for evidence of harm, the considerations for awarding reparations in the absence of complete documentation, and the challenges faced by victims in proving their claims. These references provide a legal framework and context for understanding the Court's approach to assessing harm and awarding compensation in cases of human rights violations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the documents underscore the significance of providing evidence of harm in cases of human rights violations, the flexibility in requirements for supporting documents based on individual circumstances, and the considerations taken by courts when evidence is limited or unavailable. The specific case highlighted in the documents illustrates the real-world implications of these legal principles on individuals who have suffered human rights abuses.\n"
